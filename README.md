SecuICS: Secure Industrial Control Systems

📌 Overview

SecuICS (Secure Industrial Control Systems) is an open-source project focused on integrating cyber security, safety, and control mechanisms into industrial control systems (ICS). I am starting with power substations, but the goal is to expand into oil & gas, transportation, and energy infrastructure.

This project is designed for real-world security and automation of ICS, ensuring safe operation while addressing critical cyber security risks.

🔍 Why SecuICS?

Industrial control systems are increasingly targeted by cyber threats. SecuICS aims to provide:

A secure Rust-based framework for developing fail-safe ICS control systems.

A collaborative initiative for cyber security experts, industrial engineers, and Rust developers.

A real-world demonstration of secure programming applied to ICS environments.

🚀 Features & Roadmap

✅ Planned Features

Real-time system monitoring & control (voltage, current, transformer status tracking)

Security-first design (authentication, logging, anomaly detection)

Industrial communication protocols (MQTT, OPC-UA, TLS, IEC 62443 compliance)

Rust-based async architecture (real-time response with tokio)

Modular, scalable design (for different industrial sectors)

🔄 Future Expansions

Oil & Gas Sector: Secure pipeline & flow control systems.

Transportation Infrastructure: Railway & metro automation security.

Smart Grid & Power Management: Securing distributed energy systems.

👥 How to Contribute

I welcome contributions from Rust developers, ICS security experts, and industrial engineers.

🦀 Rust Developers: Work on system architecture, real-time efficiency, and security features.
